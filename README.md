This is a collection of programs that generate various Photon Transfer Curves. The programs run from PTCmaster.py, and git lfs must be installed prior to pulling PTCdataset.zip. This .zip file includes 300+ images in fits cubes for an example PTC generation, formatted correctly for use with this program. The images were taken with a pixelink pl-d753mu-bl CMOS imaging sensor with a wavelength range of 400-725 nm.
